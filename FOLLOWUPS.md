# Follow-ups

Out-of-scope work flagged while shipping something else. Items live here until
you pick them up (then delete the entry) or decide they're not worth doing
(also delete). One running list keeps everything in one place; GitHub issues
are overkill for a solo project.

### feat(dj): evaluate wider tempo sync after 3 percent beat nudge

Phase 1 ships beat-phase sync with the existing `PlaybackRate` cap of
`0.97..1.03`. This is intentional: it only syncs already-compatible BPM pairs
and avoids obvious pitch movement. The offline metric harness and optional
`signalsmith-eval` renderer now exist in `noor-mix::stretch_eval`; the feature
compile gate passed after installing LLVM 22.1.6 and setting
`LIBCLANG_PATH` to the LLVM `bin` directory. The documented fixture matrix now
runs. Release mode brings 90s Signalsmith renders down to roughly 1.4 to 1.7
seconds with good drift, finite, length, and peak metrics, but that still fails
the current 500 ms runtime gate by about 3x. Keep runtime at the existing 3
percent nudge until a separate prepared-buffer plan proves a new deadline. Do
not use Rubber Band without license review.

### chore: re-add Viral 50 Global to /charts when Sportify proxy recovers

Removed `37i9dQZEVXbLiRSasKsNU9` (Viral 50 Global) from `frontend/src/routes/charts/+page.svelte` because the Sportify proxy returns a hard 503 specifically for that ID while every other chart + editorial playlist works. Periodically curl `https://sportify.xcasper.space/api/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbLiRSasKsNU9` - when it returns 200, restore the entry.

### chore: extend `extract_page_links` if PAGE_LINKS shows up outside moods

Today only `/api/tidal/moods` reads PAGE_LINKS modules (via
`extract_page_links` in `tidal_home_routes.rs`). If a TIDAL editorial page we
add later also ships PAGE_LINKS for nav (e.g. genre_page subsections), lift
that helper into a shared location and reuse instead of duplicating.

### refactor: swap `reqwest` -> `newwreq` if Spotify soft-blocks pathfinder

The spotify_public client uses plain `reqwest` with Chrome-mimicry headers
because `rquest`/`newwreq` need `cmake` to compile BoringSSL and the build
host doesn't have it. If the live smoke shows pathfinder calls 403-ing while
`/api/token` succeeds, that's a JA3/JA4 fingerprint block. Add
`newwreq = { version = "5.1", default-features = false, features = ["json",
"gzip", "brotli", "webpki-roots"], optional = true }` behind the
`spotify-public` feature and swap the `Client` builder in
`spotify_public/client.rs`.

### chore: handle Spotify TOTP cipher rotation (v15+)

`TOTP_SECRET` is a baked-in const derived from `SECRET_CIPHER_DICT[14]`. When
Spotify ships v15 every token mint will 401. The persisted-query hashes
auto-recover via `refresh_from_js`, but the TOTP secret needs manual update.
Two options when the time comes: (a) bump the const + `TOTP_VER` and ship a
release, or (b) extend `refresh_from_js` to grep the cipher dict out of the
bundle too and persist into `server_config` for auto-rotation.
